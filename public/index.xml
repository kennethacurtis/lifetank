      <description>These are articles that caught my attention throughout the month leading up to the day of posting. I have read all of them, but most I have not fully parsed. Time constraints only allow note taking on a few things I find during the month. At some point, I may publish my Roam notes
The reading I do is not usually planned ahead of time, unless I see news promoting something being released. Usually, I stumble on a link or post while I&amp;rsquo;m poking around in a subject of interest.</description>

      <title>Being, Becoming, and Liquidity</title>

      <description>Being, Becoming, and Liquidity As a society, we have become so obsessed with Becoming that it takes away our ability to live in Being. What is Becoming? What is Being? I’ll try to connect these questions to a few topics and view them at a high level. I have a feeling that my definitions would not suffice if a strict philosopher were to view them written on paper, but I’m going to go with my own senses.</description>

      <description>My name is Kenneth. This site came about because I had so many thoughts in my head and nowhere to put them. This is a place where I will dump my ideas about philosophy, entertainment, media, technology, and general thoughts on living in this world. Not everything will be written to perfection. This will be a learning experience, and a therapeutic one. I hope whoever reads this enjoys my perspective and experience in this life.</description>

      <title>2019|2020 Booklist</title>

      <description>In the middle of 2019 I really started to make an effort to continuously be reading a book. As soon as I finished one, I should start another. The subject didn&amp;rsquo;t matter and neither did the continuation of a certain topic that I was interested in at the time. While timing did have an impact depending on what books were coming out at the time, I still made an effort to keep my choice to read a certain book up to chance.</description>

      <description>For some time I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to take the time to write down thoughts and ideas. More than those general things, I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to talk about what I&amp;rsquo;ve been researching and reading the past few years. My brother finally convinvced me to help him spin up a site that can hold all of those things. I hope to explore many things throughout the existence of this site, however long or short that is. Many things in life can happen that stifles productivity, maintaining a schedule, and writing well crafted articles.</description>
