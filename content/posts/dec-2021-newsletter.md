Newsletter for December 2021. As the structure of this newsletter forms over time, It seems that I am wanting to include more than just reading. A lot of my information consumption comes from podcasts and videos that I access throughout the day while I'm working. So far, it seems that they are important enough to me to mention here.

It's difficult not to naturally turn this into a historical repository of everything interesting I find on the internet. Functionally, I want this to serve as a reference point for readers to come back to for curated reading. Eventually, my writings will show up in their own category. For now, I seem to rather read than write.

    - In the wake of some podcasts and YouTube channels exploring philosophical topics, similar collections of guests and thinkers created spaces that started to overlap with each other. Their common discussion points include emergence, complexity, community building, embodiment, and most of all the "meta-crisis". Each majr thinker has their own opinion on what is most important, but the agreements seem to outweigh the differences. 
    - Concerning this long-form post, a contribution on LW quickly explains this group of people but by a different name colloquially called "[The Sense-Making Web](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vKDAXqyab5KRApfvE/the-sense-making-web)".
