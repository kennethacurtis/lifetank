In the middle of 2019 I really started to make an effort to continuously be reading a book. As soon as I finished one, I should start another. The subject didn't matter and neither did the continuation of a certain topic that I was interested in at the time. While timing did have an impact depending on what books were coming out at the time, I still made an effort to keep my choice to read a certain book up to chance. When I made this pact (if you want to call it that), I was heavily interested in applied AI and had just finished a massive course in deep learning. So, I had to figure out, in a general sense, what it was all about. From there my interests sort of spun out of control as they always do and I lost a specific focus. There was also a point where I gave myself some leeway when wandering from topic to topic. This was freeing in a way. Alot of my reading was directly tied to the podcasts I was and still am listening to on a daily basis. The list below is in no particular order. Some books were physical copies and others were read on my [kindle paperwhite](https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B07CXG6C9W) (which I love having for portability). 2020 is not over yet, so this list is still growing.
