These are articles that caught my attention throughout the month leading up to the day of posting. I have read all of them, but most I have not fully parsed. Time constraints only allow note taking on a few things I find during the month. At some point, I may publish my Roam notes

The reading I do is not usually planned ahead of time, unless I see news promoting something being released. Usually, I stumble on a link or post while I'm poking around in a subject of interest. Some topics may even be fairly old, but new readings for me.

Hopefully, you can find some new readings as well below.
