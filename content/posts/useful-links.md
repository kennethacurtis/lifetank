It's the day after Thanksgiving, you're sitting around and wondering "why have I looked at the same links on Reddit five times already?". Or maybe you just need to look busy to avoid contact with those other humans in your house. You're in luck, because here is a collection of some interesting sites that may help you be (or look) productive. I will start with my favorites, then list some sites according to category

## [Favorites](#favorites)

### [archive.org](https://archive.org/) - The Internet Archive
![internetarchive](/images/useful-links/internetarchive.png)

This is your one stop shop for so many different resources, and it's all free. [Music](https://archive.org/details/audio), [movies](https://archive.org/details/moviesandfilms), [books](https://archive.org/details/texts), [software](https://archive.org/details/software), you name it. You can even play a large collection of [classic PC games](https://archive.org/details/internetarcade). The Internet Archive also includes [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) which lets you explore more than 486 billion web pages saved over time. Here's what [Myspace looked like](https://web.archive.org/web/20070607094650/http://myspace.com/) on June 7th, 2005.


### [furturetimeline.net](https://www.futuretimeline.net/)
![futuretimeline](/images/useful-links/futuretimeline.png)

From the site:
> London-based writer and futurist, William James Fox, started Future Timeline back in 2008. It began as a relatively small and obscure website with a brief list of future predictions. Over the years, however, it expanded to form a lengthy and detailed [timeline](https://www.futuretimeline.net/timeline.htm) – running from the present day, through the next century and beyond, all the way to the end of the universe itself.

For example, I browsed over to the 2090 predictions. This is the decade I will be turning 80 years old. During this decade, it's said that:
* [Religion is fading from European culture](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#religion)
* [Hypersonic vactrains are widespread](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#evacuated-tube-transport)
* [SpaceX's "Starman" has a close encounter with Earth](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#starman)
* [West Antarctica is among the fastest developing regions in the world](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#westantarctica)
* [Hurricane defence fields are operational in the U.S.](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#hurricane)
* [Global fertility has stabilised at below 2.0 children per woman](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#fertility)
* [Many of the world's languages are no longer in use](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#languages)
* [Sea levels are wreaking havoc around the world](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#globalwarming)
* [Over 80% of the Amazon rainforest has been lost](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#amazon)
* [The average employee works less than 20 hours per week](https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#trends-in-working-hours-in-oecd-countries)

Just that section alone provided some really interesting content on what the future may hold.

### [futureme.org](https://www.futureme.org/)
![futureme](/images/useful-links/futureme.png)

Ever wanted to hear from yourself in the past? Write an email and get it sent to you in the future. This could turn in a very self reflective process.

### [ninite.com](https://ninite.com/)
![ninite](/images/useful-links/ninite.png)

Install all of your programs at once, without any stop gates, questions, or toolbars. Here is a [full list](https://ninite.com/applist/pro.html) of all the applications it supports. For free you can select all of the applications you want and download a customized installer/updater. There's also a [paid pro version](https://ninite.com/pro) with great features for companies that have many machines to manage and patch.

### [10minutemail.com](https://10minutemail.com/)
![10minutemail](/images/useful-links/10minutemail.png)

This site is useful if you need a quick email to read or sign up for something you don't really care about. This has dwindled down my spam by a good amount.

### [pointerpointer.com](https://pointerpointer.com/)

This is a completey useless site. But one thing is for sure, it will always point towards your pointer.
