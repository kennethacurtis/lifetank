My name is Nathan Curtis. For some time I've wanted to take the time to write down thoughts and ideas. More than those general things, I've wanted to talk about what I've been researching and reading the past few years. My brother finally convinvced me to help him spin up a site that can hold all of those things. I hope to explore many things throughout the existence of this site, however long or short that is. Many things in life can happen that stifles productivity, maintaining a schedule, and writing well crafted articles. My goal is to be diligent about those things and to always strive for the most un-biased writings. 

Here's a list of topics that I want to cover:
* Early Civilizations

* Future Civilizations

* Psychadelics

* Sensemaking

* Game B

* Economics

* Decentralization

* Programming / Tech

* AI

I Hope you find what you are looking for.
