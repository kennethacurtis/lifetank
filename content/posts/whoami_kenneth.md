My name is Kenneth. This site came about because I had so many thoughts in my head and nowhere to put them. This is a place where I will dump my ideas about philosophy, entertainment, media, technology, and general thoughts on living in this world. Not everything will be written to perfection. This will be a learning experience, and a therapeutic one. I hope whoever reads this enjoys my perspective and experience in this life.. 


*what the hell do I write next?*
