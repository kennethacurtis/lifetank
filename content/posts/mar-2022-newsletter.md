Newsletter for March 2022. This one might be verbose or long winded, but there are alot of interesting articles in my backlog. I did my best to not fill this with current event links (Russia, Ukraine invasion, etc), but the majority of my visual consumption has been current geopolitical analysis. I added a *Currently Reading* section with a link to my reading tracker, which is easier than manually adding different book links and information.
