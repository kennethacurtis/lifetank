# Lifetank: A dump of ideas

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6f72a893-5f14-4fec-ac85-78b8b088dcb5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lifetank/deploys)

Life Tank was created by [kennethacurtis](https://github.com/kennethacurtis) and co-created by [njcurtis3](https://github.com/njcurtis3). 

Our goal for this site is for it to be a repository of sorts for all of our thoughts and ideas that can hopefully be shared with the rest of the world. We also wanted to work on a development project that would help us learn new programming languages like [GO](https://golang.org/), and be able to run our own devops working environment. [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) seemed like the perfect framework to use considering that we have alot of other things to do in life offline.
