            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of 2019 I really started to make an effort to continuously be reading a book. As soon as I finished one, I should start another. The subject didn&rsquo;t matter and neither did the continuation of a certain topic that I was interested in at the time. While timing did have an impact depending on what books were coming out at the time, I still made an effort to keep my choice to read a certain book up to chance. When I made this pact (if you want to call it that), I was heavily interested in applied AI and had just finished a massive course in deep learning. So, I had to figure out, in a general sense, what it was all about. From there my interests sort of spun out of control as they always do and I lost a specific focus. There was also a point where I gave myself some leeway when wandering from topic to topic. This was freeing in a way. Alot of my reading was directly tied to the podcasts I was and still am listening to on a daily basis. The list below is in no particular order. Some books were physical copies and others were read on my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B07CXG6C9W">kindle paperwhite</a> (which I love having for portability). 2020 is not over yet, so this list is still growing.</p>

More than those general things, I&rsquo;ve wanted to talk about what I&rsquo;ve been researching and reading the past few years. My brother finally convinvced me to help him spin up a site that can hold all of those things. I hope to explore many things throughout the existence of this site, however long or short that is. Many things in life can happen that stifles productivity, maintaining a schedule, and writing well crafted articles. My goal is to be diligent about those things and to always strive for the most un-biased writings.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of topics that I want to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Early Civilizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future Civilizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychadelics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensemaking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economics</p>
</li>
<li>
