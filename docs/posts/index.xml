<p>It&rsquo;s the day after Thanksgiving, you&rsquo;re sitting around and wondering &ldquo;why have I looked at the same links on Reddit five times already?&rdquo;. Or maybe you just need to look busy to avoid contact with those other humans in your house. You&rsquo;re in luck, because here is a collection of some interesting sites that may help you be (or look) productive. I will start with my favorites, then list some sites according to category</p>
<h2 id="favoritesfavorites"><a href="#favorites">Favorites</a></h2>
<h3 id="archiveorghttpsarchiveorg---the-internet-archive"><a href="https://archive.org/">archive.org</a> - The Internet Archive</h3>
<p><img src="/images/useful-links/internetarchive.png" alt="internetarchive"></p>
<p>This is your one stop shop for so many different resources, and it&rsquo;s all free. <a href="https://archive.org/details/audio">Music</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/moviesandfilms">movies</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/texts">books</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/software">software</a>, you name it. You can even play a large collection of <a href="https://archive.org/details/internetarcade">classic PC games</a>. The Internet Archive also includes <a href="https://archive.org/web/">The Wayback Machine</a> which lets you explore more than 486 billion web pages saved over time. Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070607094650/http://myspace.com/">Myspace looked like</a> on June 7th, 2005.</p>
<h3 id="furturetimelinenethttpswwwfuturetimelinenet"><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/">furturetimeline.net</a></h3>
<p><img src="/images/useful-links/futuretimeline.png" alt="futuretimeline"></p>
<p>From the site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>London-based writer and futurist, William James Fox, started Future Timeline back in 2008. It began as a relatively small and obscure website with a brief list of future predictions. Over the years, however, it expanded to form a lengthy and detailed <a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/timeline.htm">timeline</a> – running from the present day, through the next century and beyond, all the way to the end of the universe itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, I browsed over to the 2090 predictions. This is the decade I will be turning 80 years old. During this decade, it&rsquo;s said that:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#religion">Religion is fading from European culture</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#evacuated-tube-transport">Hypersonic vactrains are widespread</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#starman">SpaceX&rsquo;s &ldquo;Starman&rdquo; has a close encounter with Earth</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#westantarctica">West Antarctica is among the fastest developing regions in the world</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#hurricane">Hurricane defence fields are operational in the U.S.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#fertility">Global fertility has stabilised at below 2.0 children per woman</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#languages">Many of the world&rsquo;s languages are no longer in use</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#globalwarming">Sea levels are wreaking havoc around the world</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#amazon">Over 80% of the Amazon rainforest has been lost</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.futuretimeline.net/21stcentury/2090-2099.htm#trends-in-working-hours-in-oecd-countries">The average employee works less than 20 hours per week</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Just that section alone provided some really interesting content on what the future may hold.</p>

<h3 id="10minutemailcomhttps10minutemailcom"><a href="https://10minutemail.com/">10minutemail.com</a></h3>
<p><img src="/images/useful-links/10minutemail.png" alt="10minutemail"></p>
<p>This site is useful if you need a quick email to read or sign up for something you don&rsquo;t really care about. This has dwindled down my spam by a good amount.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name is Kenneth. This site came about because I had so many thoughts in my head and nowhere to put them. This is a place where I will dump my ideas about philosophy, entertainment, media, technology, and general thoughts on living in this world. Not everything will be written to perfection. This will be a learning experience, and a therapeutic one. I hope whoever reads this enjoys my perspective and experience in this life.</p>

            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the middle of 2019 I really started to make an effort to continuously be reading a book. As soon as I finished one, I should start another. The subject didn&rsquo;t matter and neither did the continuation of a certain topic that I was interested in at the time. While timing did have an impact depending on what books were coming out at the time, I still made an effort to keep my choice to read a certain book up to chance. When I made this pact (if you want to call it that), I was heavily interested in applied AI and had just finished a massive course in deep learning. So, I had to figure out, in a general sense, what it was all about. From there my interests sort of spun out of control as they always do and I lost a specific focus. There was also a point where I gave myself some leeway when wandering from topic to topic. This was freeing in a way. Alot of my reading was directly tied to the podcasts I was and still am listening to on a daily basis. The list below is in no particular order. Some books were physical copies and others were read on my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B07CXG6C9W">kindle paperwhite</a> (which I love having for portability). 2020 is not over yet, so this list is still growing.</p>

            <description>For some time I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to take the time to write down thoughts and ideas.</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For some time I&rsquo;ve wanted to take the time to write down thoughts and ideas. More than those general things, I&rsquo;ve wanted to talk about what I&rsquo;ve been researching and reading the past few years. My brother finally convinvced me to help him spin up a site that can hold all of those things. I hope to explore many things throughout the existence of this site, however long or short that is. Many things in life can happen that stifles productivity, maintaining a schedule, and writing well crafted articles. My goal is to be diligent about those things and to always strive for the most un-biased writings.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of topics that I want to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Early Civilizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Future Civilizations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychadelics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sensemaking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Game B</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Economics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decentralization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Programming / Tech</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AI</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I Hope you find what you are looking for.</p>
